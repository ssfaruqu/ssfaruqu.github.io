Hello! My name is Seeum Faruque, and I am a Computer Science Master's student at UCSC. After graduating from UCSC with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2022, I decided to go back to do the Master's program while
looking for internships and other job opportunities. My research interests are in databases, specifically with distributed database systems and database compression. I am eager to get my foot in the door of this exciting field.

Projects
========
One project I greatly enjoyed was in a computer graphics course in which we needed to create a completely original and interactable graphic scenario using three.js. For this, I tried to create a lovecraftian creature in a horror scenario.

A more recent project of mine is creating an ASCII tactical-RPG from scratch in Python. I decided to do this in order to reinforce concepts I learned throughout my undergrad studies, from things as simple as
inheritence to more complex topics like machine learning algorithms using heuristics (the enemy AI).

Hobbies & Interests
=================== 
While I pursue computer science professionally, I also practice drawing as an off-and-on hobby. I certainly wouldn't say I'm good at it, but I do like seeing my skills improve over the years I continue. I also practice creative writing, though to a much lesser extent.
