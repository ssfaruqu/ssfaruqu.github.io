Hello! My name is Seeum Faruque, and I am a Computer Science Master's student at UCSC. After graduating from UCSC with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2022, I decided to go back to do the Master's program while
looking for internships and other job opportunities. I am eager to get my foot in the door of this exciting field.
